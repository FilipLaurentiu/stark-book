# Cairo

There's different ways to write for the Cairo VM:

* using Cairo instructions directly, documented in the Cairo paper (good luck) 
* using Cairo 0, a low-level language documented here https://docs.cairo-lang.org/how_cairo_works/builtins.html
* using Cairo 1, a rust-like high-level language documented here https://book.cairo-lang.org/
